    // üßê Hmm will 'name' always stay constant as a variable? If not, what keyword(s) can we use instead to declare 'name' as a variable that can be updated by the user's input?
    
    @State private var food: String = ""
    @State private var showAlert = false
    // üî• Ooh the property wrappers you added to your variables look great!
    // üôà I especially like how you set showAlert initially to false, so our user doesn't get the alert before entering their name & fav food

            // üí° Tip: Don't forget to add the '$' before the variable name! It will tell SwiftUI to read the value from name, and if it changes, to update it automatically with the value from TextField.

            // ‚ù§Ô∏è The syntax for the .alert() is so solid! I love how you updated the information for the Button and binded showAlert.
            // üí° Tip: Try using single backslashes for string interpolation!
